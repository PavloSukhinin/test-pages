    <strong>Hello, world! 👋</strong><br />
    I will tell you about all the joys of modern JavaScript, starting from the basic syntax and ending <em>(carefully, jargon!)</em> with modules, transpilers, and bundlers. Before you start - a few disclaimers about the content of the lecture:<br />
    <ol class="compact inverted">
      <li>Some terms and technologies are covered superficially;</li>
      <li>"- Should I click on all the links to the documentation and read all the articles?" Well-u-u-u-u, up to you;</li>
      <li>Everything should be interesting and as informative as possible, but you’ll see how it will turn out ... Have fun! 🙃</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And another <strong>heads up</strong> - you will need your favorite <strong>IDE</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and the <a href="https://github.com/binary-studio-academy/stage-2-es6-for-everyone"><strong>project starter</strong></a> (I will compose it during the lecture). Ready? Let's go!</p>

  The student is still on probation at his new company and is still using Slack to collaborate with other developers and communicate with customers. Ryu writes in the chat one warm spring evening - a former customer <em>(returning customer, ya-a-a-ay!)</em>, for whom an online resume was previously made. He is completely satisfied with the quality of our work and wants to entrust us with another project &mdash;

So, there is no specification, but it seems that this time we are talking about a "street fight" simulator - a game in which the player chooses two fighters, who in turn fight, slapping each other with their hands, feet, and head. Whoever runs out of lives first - loses. In fact, they do not die because they are virtual.

🤭Oh ... 🤔Or they die ... The customer didn’t provide any specific technical task, so we will make it ourselves. So is the design. Let it be just a browser game in the beginning, in which one character systematically beats another and vice versa, and a moderately complex algorithm determines how hard the blow was inflicted and how much life is left in the slow loser who did not have time to dodge to be elbowed in the nose. And then we'll see what new functionality or design you can manage to code before the deadline. Well, assure the client that everything is under control and to work?

  <strong>Yeah, sure, I'm on it, let's go!</strong> I'm gonna target modern browsers and will start with the plain JavaScript using new ES6 features where necessary. Sometime in the future, when the project evolves, we'll use libraries like React or Vue.js, but for now, vanilla JavaScript will do the job just fine.

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ready to try <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a>?</strong></p>
    <p>To start with, here are <strong>the main points</strong> you should remember about JS:</p>
    <p><span class="chip">Brendan Eich</span><span class="chip">EcmaScript</span><span class="chip">script language</span><span class="chip">dynamic language</span><span class="chip">weakly typed</span><span class="chip">first-class functions</span><span class="chip">object-oriented</span><span class="chip">prototype-based</span><span class="chip">single-threaded</span><span class="chip">asynchronous</span></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/code-comments-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-be9cc65fbf83">Putting comments in code</a></strong></p>
    <p>The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages. Comments behave like white space and are discarded during script execution.</p>
    <SnippetL01S01 />
    <SnippetL01S02 />
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Declaring block:</strong></p>
    <p>A <strong>block statement</strong> (or <strong>compound statement</strong> in other languages) is used to group zero or more statements. The <strong>block</strong> is delimited by a pair of braces:</p>
    <SnippetL01S03 />
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Declaring variables: <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code></strong></p>
    <p>There are three kinds of declarations in JavaScript:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="details">
        <input type="checkbox" id="accordion-3-1" />
        <label class="summary" for="accordion-3-1">
          <code>var</code> declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value
        </label>
        <div class="details-body">
          Declaration will be hoisted to the global scope or a function block scope. Variable defined inside of the inner scope can override another variable from the outer scope. <strong>That's why it mustn't be used in the modern JS code!</strong>
          <SnippetL01S04 />
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="details">
        <input type="checkbox" id="accordion-3-2" />
        <label class="summary" for="accordion-3-2">
          <code>let</code> declares a local block-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value
        </label>
        <div class="details-body">
          Declaration won't be hoisted but will create a new locally scoped variable.
          <SnippetL01S05 />
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="details">
        <input type="checkbox" id="accordion-3-3" />
        <label class="summary" for="accordion-3-3">
          <code>const</code> declares a local block-scoped read-only constant variable
        </label>
        <div class="details-body">
          Variable cannot be <strong>reassigned</strong>, but objects defined with <code>const</code> can be changed
          <SnippetL01S06 />
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Data Types</strong></p>
    <p>According to the <strong>ECMAScript</strong>, there are seven primitive types and everything else is an <code>Object</code> type. Let’s run over those one by one:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="details">
        <input type="checkbox" id="accordion-4-1" />
        <label class="summary" for="accordion-4-1">
          <strong>Boolean</strong>
        </label>
        <div class="details-body">
          <p>The boolean type has two values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</p>
          <SnippetL01S07 />
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="details">
        <input type="checkbox" id="accordion-4-2" />
        <label class="summary" for="accordion-4-2">
          <strong>Number</strong>
        </label>
        <div class="details-body">
          <p>An integer or floating point number.</p>
          <SnippetL01S08 />
          <SnippetL01S09 />
          The number type has three symbolic values: `+Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` (not-a-number).
          <SnippetL01S10 />
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="details">
        <input type="checkbox" id="accordion-4-3" />
        <label class="summary" for="accordion-4-3">
          <strong>BigInt</strong> <em>(added in ES2020)</em>
        </label>
        <div class="details-body">
          <p>Represents who represent whole numbers larger than <code>2<sup>53</sup> - 1</code> which is larger than maximum value of <code>Number</code> type.</p>
          <SnippetL01S26 />
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="details">
        <input type="checkbox" id="accordion-4-4" />
        <label class="summary" for="accordion-4-4">

    <p>Function is a "subprogram" that can be called by code external (or internal in the case of the recursion) to the function. <br/>A function is composed of a sequence of statements called the <strong>function body</strong>. Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value. In JavaScript, functions are <strong>first-class objects</strong>, because they <strong>can have properties and methods</strong> just like any other object. <br/> There are three ways to declare function in Javascript:</p>

    <p>Let's learn more about the <strong>transpilers</strong> — tools that read source code written in one programming language, and produce the equivalent code in another language. The most popular one, <a href="https://babeljs.io/"><strong>Babel</strong></a>, is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Let's try it out:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"><strong>node.js</strong></a>, open <strong>Terminal</strong> in Visual Studio Code <sup><em>(Terminal</em> &rarr; <em>New Terminal)</em></sup>, and run <code>npm init</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now install <strong>babel</strong> with <code>npm i -D @babel/core @babel/cli</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add <code>"scripts"</code> to the <strong>package.json</strong> file
        <div>
          <SnippetL03S06 />
        </div>
        and run <code>npm run build</code> in the terminal to see if it works
      </li>
      <li>
        Set up transpiling of ES2015+ code — <code>npm install @babel/preset-env --save-dev</code>, create a <strong>.babelrc</strong> in the root of your project, with the following content:
        <div>
          <SnippetL03S07 />
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Let's watch for changes by running <code>babel</code> with <code>-w</code> flag
        <div>
          <SnippetL03S09 />
        </div>
